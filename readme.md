### Overview

This Android application utilizes ML Kit's Face Detection API to detect faces in images or live
camera feeds.
It also integrates Ktor for making network requests and Gson for JSON serialization.
This app is connected to a server that stores employee data and uses the face detection feature to
verify the identity of employees.
